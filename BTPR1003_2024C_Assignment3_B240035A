 Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students and each student’s name and score, and finally displays the name of the student with the highest and the name of the student with the lowest score. Use the next() method in the Scanner class to read a name, rather than using the nextLine() method.
 Here is a sample run: 

 

Enter the number of students: 5 

Enter a student name: John 

Enter a student score: 78 

Enter a student name: Peter 

Enter a student score: 45 

Enter a student name: Jocelyn 

Enter a student score: 98 

Enter a student name: Mark 

Enter a student score: 88 

Enter a student name: Moses 

Enter a student score: 99 


The name of the student with highest score: Moses's score is 99.0. 

The name of the student with lowest score: Peter’s score is 45.0.*/
